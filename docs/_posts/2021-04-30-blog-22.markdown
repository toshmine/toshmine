<p>Hello world! Last week I talked about what Security Onion is and what it is composed of. This week, I would to help install Security Onion so we can mess around with it and see it work in action.</p>

Lets first download the <a href="https://blog.securityonion.net/">Security Onion ISO</a>. Once the download is complete, you have one of two options; You can either download the operating system on your computer natively, or you can download the operating system virtually on your computer via VirtualBox or VMWare. I personally recommend VirtualVBox due to the fact that this is all testing to learn. If something goes wrong, you can always close out the virtual machine and start over. 

 <ul>
    
<li> <p>When Click Install security Onion 12.4. Then Preparing to Install and given two checkbox true values.</p> </li>

<br>

<li> <p>The installer will then prompt you on if you would want to partition the harddrive. If you are doing this in a virtual machine environment, this is no issue to you since you can determine how  much space you want to give the operating system..</p> </li>

<br>

<li> <p>The installer will now also prompt you for a Given Username and Password of the system. No need to select encrypted my home folder and click Continue.</p> </li>

<br>

<li> <p>When the installation has been successfully completed, the system will prompt you for a system reboot.</p> </li>

</ul>

<br>

<p> Once the reboot completes, you are good to go! That's all folks! Tune in next time :) .</p>
