<p>Hello world! This week I learned more about SQL servers and techniques as to how to make the server as secure as possible. There are different ways to make sure it stays safe and those different ways have different advantages. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Best practices are: </h3> 

 <ol type="1">
    
<li> <p> <i> <b>Server Isolate</b> </i>: Prevents the computer from targeting software and programs. Using an independent server enables monitoring of all traffic allowed. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Simple / Light Installs</b></i>: Only download the needed programs and services. Avoid downloading additional programs or any other unwanted software to develop vulnerabilities on your server. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Update Constantly</b></i>: Updating regularly requires security updates to be applied automatically, making it harder for any hacker to target the server. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Login</b></i>: Making sure several unsuccessful logins cause the account to be locked ensures maximum security. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Restrict Access</b></i>: Servers should not be managed by administrators but instead by a local account. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Backup</b></i>: Keeping a backup makes sure that you don't lose all your files in one go. </p> </li>

<br><br>

<li> <p> <i> <b>Keep Watch</b></i>: Continuous monitoring can help to detect any issues, as that will fix the problem earlier rather than later. </p> </li>

<br><br>

</ol>

<br>

<p> I hope these best practices come to your advantage! Thatâ€™s all folks! Tune in next week :) </p>
