<h1>Commands for IDPS with Security Onion</h1>

  <p>Hello world! There is just so much to uncover using this Security Onion. Every week, it feels like I am learning a new layer to the operating system. Almost like an Onio- Ohhh that's probably where it gets its name from. </p>

  <br><br>

<p>Run the following command inside Security Onion terminal 
  <br>
  <b><i> sudo tcpreplay –i enp0s3 –M10 /opt/samples/markofu/honeynet_suspicious-time.pcap </b></i>. 
  <br>
  
  <p>There should be a Realtime Event that shows up. It gave me an event messaged that reads, “Alert I.D: 3.1. Event message: unsupported/fake Firefox version 0.” Given what we know so far, we can conclude that this malicious traffic was caught by IDS by the ET policy. It also tells us in the “Event Message” column. </p>
  
    <br><br>

<p>Run the following command inside Security Onion terminal 
  <br>
  <b><i> sudo tcpreplay –i enp0s3 –M10 /opt/samples/bredolab-sample.pcap </b></i>.
  <br>
  
<p>There should be about six Realtime Events showed up as a result of running bredolabsample.pcap. Through this, we can conclude that this malicious traffic was caught by the IDS because of the ET TROJAN/POLICY. The IDS found these by monitoring the traffic.</p>
  
    <br><br>

<p>Run the following command inside Security Onion terminal 
  <br>
  <b><i> sudo tcpreplay –i enp0s3 –M10 /opt/samples/zeus-sample-3.pcap</b></i>.
  <br>
<p>There should be about eight Realtime events show up as a result of running zeus-sample3.pcap. We can also see the source IP address and its destination IP Address. Under the CNT field in SGuil, I found 12 correlated events that match this event.</p>

<br><br>

<p> These are just a few commands that I have found that actually taught me a good amount. There are many more out there and I hope these blogs have sparked your interests. That's all folks! Thank you for sticking with me to the end of the semester / academic year :) ! </p>
